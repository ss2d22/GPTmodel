    "    - Gradient descent helps us minimise the loss by adjusting model parameters itteratively\n",

    "\n",
    "- #### iii) what are optimizers ?\n",

    "    - There are many optimisers, we will use AdamW which combines ideas from momentum and it uses a moving average of both the gradient and it's square parameter to adapt the learning rate of each parameter from Adam and adds weight decay to the adam algorithm (it generalises the parameters more)\n",
    "    - weight decay generalises the perfomance insrtead of having high or low level performance, weight significance will shrink as graph flattens out.\n",
    "    - lets say some weights give insanely high or low performance weight decay , will decay the performance to normalise it.\n",

    "- #### iv) what is Learning Rate ?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -  A hyperparameter that determines the size of the steps taken during optimization.\n",

    "            - Mean Squared Error (MSE): MSE is a common loss function used in regression problems, where the goal is to predict a continuous output. It measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values, and is often used to train neural networks for regression tasks.\n",
    "            - Gradient Descent (GD): is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function of a machine learning model. The loss function measures how well the model is able to predict the target variable based on the input features. The idea of GD is to iteratively adjust the model parameters in the direction of the steepest descent of the loss function\n",
    "            - Momentum: Momentum is an extension of SGD that adds a \"momentum\" term to the parameter updates. This term helps smooth out the updates and allows the optimizer to continue moving in the right direction, even if the gradient changes direction or varies in magnitude. Momentum is particularly useful for training deep neural networks.\n",
    "            - RMSprop: RMSprop is an optimization algorithm that uses a moving average of the squared gradient to adapt the learning rate of each parameter. This helps to avoid oscillations in the parameter updates and can improve convergence in some cases.\n",
    "            - Adam: Adam is a popular optimization algorithm that combines the ideas of momentum and RMSprop. It uses a moving average of both the gradient and its squared value to adapt the learning rate of each parameter. Adam is often used as a default optimizer for deep learning models.\n",
    "            - AdamW: AdamW is a modification of the Adam optimizer that adds weight decay to the parameter updates. This helps to regularize the model and can improve generalization performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - learning rate is something we need to experiment with to figure out the ideal value, if it is too slow it is bad as we would not want to wait months for a simple bigram model , too fast is bad as it can overshoot\n",
    "    - The optimizer updates the model's parameters based on the computed gradients to minimize the loss function.\n",
    "- #### ii) Implement the Training Loop\n",
    "    - Iteratively trains the model by processing batches of data, computing loss, performing backpropagation, and updating model parameters\n",
    "    - ```for iter in range(max_iterations):``` loop runs from 0 to max_iterations - 1\n",
    "    - in each itteration :\n",
    "        - ```inputs, targets = get_batch('train')``` Retrieves a batch of input data (inputs) and corresponding target data (targets) from the training set\n",
    "        - ```logits, loss = model.forward_pass(inputs, targets)```Performs a forward pass through the model, computing the logits (raw predictions) and the loss\n",
    "        - ```optimizer.zero_grad(set_to_none=True)``` Resets the gradients of all optimized parameters to none (instead of 0 due to set_to_none=True)\n",
    "        - ```loss.backward()``` Performs backpropagation, calculating gradients based on the computed loss with respect to each model parameter. (Each parameter's .grad attribute is populated with the gradient of the loss with respect to that parameter)\n",
    "        - ```optimizer.step()``` Updates the model's parameters based on the computed gradients to minimize the loss.(Uses the gradients stored in .grad attributes to perform parameter updates (gradient descent) ,Applies regularization to prevent overfitting by penalizing large weights as we are using AdamW)\n",
    "        - ```if iter % 100 == 0: (new line) print(f\"Iteration {iter}, Loss: {loss.item()}\")``` logs the loss every 100 iterations\n",
    "    - ```print(loss.item())``` print the final loss\n",
    "- #### iii) define the estimate loss function\n",
    "    - we put the model in evaluation mode to estimate losses  "
